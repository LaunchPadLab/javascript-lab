Our Javascript Lab - Learn, Code, Build

Lab #1 - We're going to wire up a simple four function calculator in Javascript using a bit of jQuery and good ole Javascript. Fork this repository to pull down lesson #1 and let's get coding.

Lab #2 - We'll dive into a new example using jQuery, jQuery-UI and javascript on a sign up form. This example will focus on showing and hiding elements on a page and using jQuery UI's datepicker and autocomplete widgets.

Lab #3 - We'll dive into a new example using Ajax and the Twitter Search API. This example will focus on making asynchronous javascript requests that are super powerful in a Rails app. At the end of class, we will take what we've learned and try to implement it in a Rails app.
